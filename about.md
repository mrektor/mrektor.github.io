My name is Ettore Mariotti, I am a graduating student in Telecommunication Enginnering (A MsC after a bachelor in Information Enginnering).
My recent passion is Machine Learning in general, I've had some experience both in data-scarce (Brain Computer Interfaces problems) and in data-rich situations (IACT MAGIC reconstruction with CNNs).
I have good experience in scientific programming in python, MATLAB and Wolfram Language.

You can find some recent academic work developed by me [here](https://github.com/mrektor/works_collection)
